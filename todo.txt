Do:
- command to toggle notifications in base_parser

- variable expansion format $(varname) as well as $varname
    completer also must work with this, even $(var1)$(va [TAB] should complete.

- allow starting proxies from CLI
    command create name remotehost localport remoteport
    make sure name doesn't exist already

- allow stopping proxies from CLI
    command kill [name] - if name empty, kill current and select first
    make sure either always 1 active or some form of fallback is in place if no proxies exist

- allow running of scripts from file
    command run file

- allow renaming of proxies
    command rename [newName]
    make sure to also update the name attribute in the proxy itself
    make sure to adjust the keys in all relevant dictionaries
      d[newKey] = d.pop(oldKey)
    make sure that a proxy with that name doesn't exist already

- allow selecting proxies by ID and binding port
  command select proxyname|ID|Port
    ID goes first if both port and ID exist (unlikely)

Fix:
- Latest command not part of history
- clearhistory <id> not working
- pack/unpack c_string and pascal_string not working right
- no prompt after parser output
