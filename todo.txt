Do:
- variable expansion format $(varname) as well as $varname
    completer also must work with this, even $(var1)$(va [TAB] should complete.

- allow running of scripts from file
    command run file

- docstrings for all functions, modules and classes

- make all readline module changes through function calls to application instead of getting readline

Fix:
- Latest command not part of history
- clearhistory <id> not working
- pack/unpack c_string and pascal_string not working right
- no prompt after parser output
- file completion not working with filenames with spaces
