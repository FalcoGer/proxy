Do:
- Naming stype eSocketRole and members

- More typing, such as typing.Final

- Replace readline/pyreadline3 with python-prompt-toolkit
    https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit
    - replace completion
        see fix: autocomplete not working in windows
        https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/asking_for_input.html#autocompletion
    - Make layouts to separate output from prompt https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/full_screen_apps.html
    - replace colorama with https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/printing_text.html#ansi
    - eventually replace termcolor (hexdump and base_parser)

- Test every command
    - core and passthrough
    - too few, too many, wrong type, bad value arguments
    - correct types and values, check expected effect
        include and exclude optional arguments
        check completion for every command

- variable expansion format $(varname) as well as $varname
    completer also must work with this, even $(var1)$(va [TAB] should complete.

- cleanup application functions

- docstrings for all functions, modules and classes

- documentation
    example of stringing proxies together with different parsers

- Make a PwnieIsland: PwnAdventure 3 proxy :)

- Expand scripting with loops and functions and such

Fix:
- pack/unpack c_string and pascal_string not working right
- file completion not working with filenames with spaces
- strange behavior when cursor not at end of line when packets are handled
    - moving cursor causes issues
    - getting output puts that output in the middle of the input line
- Autocomplete not working in windows.


Ideas:
- Allow "proxies" with connection to remote or listening sockets only to have the proxy act as the server/client, ie. a more fancy netcat
    would allow simulating clients/servers with custom parsers that react to messages
    would allow sending more complex data than with netcat, and easily send files without reconnecting
    - import sockethandler into server and client classes, same as proxy, except the setup is different, should be easy

- Allow MitM SSL?

- IPv6 support

- SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP, HTTPS proxy in addition to raw tcp packet forwarding?
    With login?
    Chain to remote SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP or HTTPS proxy (like TOR)?
