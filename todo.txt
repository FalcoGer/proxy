Do:
- Test every command
    - core and passthrough
    - too few, too many, wrong type, bad value arguments
    - correct types and values, check expected effect
        include and exclude optional arguments
        check completion for every command

- variable expansion format $(varname) as well as $varname
    completer also must work with this, even $(var1)$(va [TAB] should complete.

- docstrings for all functions, modules and classes

- documentation
    example of stringing proxies together with different parsers

- Make a PwnieIsland: PwnAdventure 3 proxy :)

- Expand scripting with loops and functions and such

Fix:
- pack/unpack c_string and pascal_string not working right
- file completion not working with filenames with spaces
- strange behavior when cursor not at end of line when packets are handled
    - moving cursor causes issues
    - getting output puts that output in the middle of the input line
- no prompt after connection/disconnect/other messages.

Ideas:
- Allow "proxies" with connection to remote or listening sockets only to have the proxy act as the server/client, ie. a more fancy netcat
    would allow simulating clients/servers with custom parsers that react to messages
    would allow sending more complex data than with netcat, and easily send files without reconnecting

- Allow MitM SSL?
